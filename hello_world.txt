The galaxy. Trillions of stars waiting to be explored. Where wonderous creations mingle with desires and encounters with the unknown. Where the urge to go beyon, and to determine one's fate, is universal. Where, from the ashes of devastation, a new dawn may rise, revealing a deeper understanding. And this seemingly endless galaxy is still there; lingering, waiting, for our next move, knowing that its greatest story still lies ahead. And it's yours to tell.
